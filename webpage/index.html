         <h3>Current Project</h3>
    We have designed a project of incorporating verdazyl free radicals, which are a class of stable free radicals that can be used for versatile probes for a variety of systems, with crown ethers, well known for its binding properties for sensing applications.

   <h3> PhD project </h3> 
An aza crown system coupled with two anthraquinone moieties shows selective fluorescence detection of Mg(II) in the nanomolar range with 2:1 (L:M) binding stoichiometry. In addition, the compound has been used in the bioimaging of Mg (II) in embryonic mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells.
